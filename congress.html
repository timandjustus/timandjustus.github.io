			<font color="white" size="14">Both in the federal and state government, the legislative branch is responsible for making and passing laws. The federal legislative<br>branch, Congress, operates based on the Constitution, which states in Article 1 what<br>areas of law are meant for this Congress, such as issues that affect the entire country, including declaration of war and<br>regulation of the military. Meanwhile, state legislation operates based on the specific constitution of that state.</font>
