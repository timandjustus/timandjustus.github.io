The federal legislative<br>branch, Congress, operates based on the<br>Constitution, which states in Article 1 what<br>areas of law are meant for this Congress,<br>such as issues that affect the entire<br>country, including declaration of war and<br>regulation of the military. Meanwhile, state<br>legislation operates based on the specific<br>constitution of that state.</font>
