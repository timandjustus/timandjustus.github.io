The federal legislative branch, Congress, operates based on the Constitution, which states in Article 1 what areas of law are meant for this Congress, such as issues that affect the entire country, including declaration of war and regulation of the military. Meanwhile, state legislation operates based on the specific constitution of that state.</font>
